# Mobile-Number-Verification-with-OTP
NOTE that one should have an account in TEXTLOCAL to use this service. Also, I couldn't find any free sms services.So, better buy one if you need one.

## Information that you need to know to use this
Controller.php asks for API KEY which is the key provided by textlocal.
Instead u can use your email and password that is used for textlocal.
After changing this in controller.php change sender name.
Textlocal provides you with a sender name which is not given in case of free trial accounts.
Most other specifications are available on the internet. To know more visit https://www.textlocal.in/how-to-guides/
